# solr (WIP)

Just `git clone`, `nvm use`, `npm i`, and then `gulp`.

## How to play

Click and draw creates a circle/planet/body. When you release you can see the starting velocity using the line. Click to release the body and watch it go.

## Known Bugs
- When a body is destroyed whilst drawing a new one, the position of the drawing bugs out

## Ideas
- Zoom
- Right click to follow a body
- Time control
- Maybe have some precreated models of known solar systems

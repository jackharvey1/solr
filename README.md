# solr (WIP)

Just `git clone`, `nvm use`, `npm i`, and then `gulp`.

Note this is WIP and basically does nothing interesting at the moment.

## Known Bugs

- When a body is destroyed whilst drawing a new one, the position of the drawing bugs out

## Future plans
- Time control
- Maybe have some precreated models of known solar systems

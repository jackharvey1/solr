Just `git clone`, `nvm use`, `npm i`, `gulp`, then visit `localhost:3000`.

## How to play

### Creating
Click to specify the centre of the body, then drag to define the radius. Then a line will show from the centre. Think of this like a sling shot, where a longer line means more power, and the mouse point to the centre shows the direction. Click again to release.  

### Following
You can click a body to follow it, and click it again to unfollow.

### Camera
`Z` zooms out, and `A` zooms in. Use the arrow keys to pan

## Known Bugs
None

## Ideas
- Time control
- Maybe have some precreated models of known solar systems
